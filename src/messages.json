    "i love you": ["Listen to me, okay? I’m in love with you. I love you every second of the day. And I’ve never loved anyone as I love you. I cry over you not because I’m in pain but because I feel so blessed that I just can’t hide my emotions. You are on my mind every moment. I’ve never missed anyone as I miss you. You are someone special to me. Please be with me forever and ever.",
    "I can only use so many words in the dictionary to show you how much I love you. I love you so much that you are always on my mind, putting a smile on my face and making my heart skip a beat. There are so many ways to express my love, and I plan to show you just how much love I have for you for the rest of my life. I hope that my actions let you know the extent of my affection, adoration, and commitment to you.",
"I want you every second of every day from now until the end of forever. I didn’t believe in love, and now I understand that I just spent my time gratuitously. But, being with you has changed my outlook on love and life entirely. I now know true love exists. Because I found it with you. I love you.",
"Before I met you; I didn’t think love was for me. It was something other people had and felt. Something in movies and TV shows. It felt more like a wish I had than something real. Now that I’m with you, love is so much more tangible. It’s something I can reach out and touch. It’s so much more than a wish or a hope (though it does give me hope for so many things); it’s the genuine, wonderful person I wake up to—the warm hand next to mine, the brush of hair against my cheek. I love you, and because of that love, I love so much more than you. I love myself and the world in a way I never thought possible. You’ve made that possible for me. You’ve made everything possible.",
"With ferocity filled with tenderness, you have captured my soul and every bit of me, making me feel like the only man in the world. Life without you is like living without a backbone system. Your raft of love and kindness has held me afloat and will keep on lighting our path. I promise to never leave you.",
"I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close.",
"I love you. That is all I know. I hope that you know that I will always be there for you. It is not just for the good times when we are celebrating and enjoying life, but for the bad times. When you are sad, stressed out, or angry, just know that I will be by your side to see you through the tough times. I will hold your hand and lead you through the storm. And when things are going great, I will be there to cheer you on and dance with you.",
"So just to brag on my amazing girlfriend for a minute! You are so sweet, and I’m so blessed to have such a thoughtful wonderful woman in my life. I love you, honey! I can’t wait to start the rest of my life with you!! You mean the absolute world to me, and I’m so happy to have you! Thank you for continuing to make me happy every single day! You’re beyond perfect.",
"Everything you do, The way you eat, the way you smile, the way my name rolls off of your tongue. That all is what keeps me going. It gives me so much joy to watch you be you. I would never give my attention to anyone else because I love giving it to you. The day when you were born, it was raining. It wasn’t raining itself, but heaven was crying for losing the most beautiful Angel!",
"The sun is rising in the sky, but to me, the day doesn’t start until you’ve risen out of bed. You’re the only source of light and warmth I need, lighting up my life with your smile and warming me with your mere presence. Now that you’ve gotten up and read this, my day has indeed started. Thank you!","I want you to know that there’s no one who can replace you. The way you look. The way you always know what I am thinking about. The way you hug me when I need it the most. The way you listen to me. It’s all priceless. You have touched me more than I ever thought you could. I am head over heels in love with you.",
"You’re my best friend. The person I can tell all my secrets to, the first person I want to talk to when I wake up, and the last person I want to talk to before I drift off to sleep. When something good happens to me, you’re the first person I want to tell. When I’m troubled by something or if I get bad news, you’re the one I go to for comfort and support. But you’re so much more to me than a friend; you’re the love of my life. You’re my friend, my lover, my comfort, and my strength. I am so lucky to have you. I just wanted you to know how happy I am to have you in my life.",
"The doctor took an x-ray of my heart and almost fainted. He asked me what happened with a scared look on his face. I told him, don’t worry, I gave my heart to you. That’s why it is missing.",
"Watching you walk across a room is the greatest gift. The way you move is so graceful and effortless. The way you smile makes me feel at peace. Knowing you’re walking towards me is a feeling so hard to describe. It’s like coming home, a comfort; only the home is coming to me. I will never know such love, such peace, as you. You’re my home.",
"I know we’ll be together, always and forever; you have loved me alright regardless of my shortcomings; it’s incredible getting all the best from you, knowing I don’t deserve it, but you keep telling me, God is on our side, your smile brightens up my day. Love you so much, dear.",
"I want you to know that you are the most essential thing in my life. You’re the reason I do everything. When I get up in the morning, I feel so grateful for every second I have with you and have here on Earth. You give my life meaning; you give my days such joy; you are the reason I smile. Thank you for being with me, for joining me on this journey through life. Your love is everything to me.",
"Is it already dark there? It is already dark here. There are a large number of stars in the sky. The sky always amazes me. It seems to be limitless without any boundaries. You have a strange resemblance to this sky. You amaze me just like this beautiful sky, and my feelings for you have no limitations. I am simply unable to put limits or boundaries to my love for you. It keeps on increasing.",
"When you came into my life, I left all my past behind me. I just love this newly found love that makes me feel like a baby again, my sugar I adore you so much.",
"I must be the luckiest man in the world to have such a special person for their love. When I am next to you, I am always pinching myself to confirm that what I see is real. You are everything that I ever needed in this life, and I cannot imagine life without you. I love you, darling.",
"A day that is void of your voice is to mean an incomplete one. For with your voice comes the soul melting laughter, which is all I need to have a great and happy day. I hope mine makes you feel the same way.",
"You are subtly beautiful, the quintessence of magical charm, and the carrier of vibrant optimism for purposeful living. Don’t be surprised that I envy you. A lot!",
"As the dew of the morning, your love brings refreshment to my soul. As the night can’t have enough of the stars, so my life depends on the light of your love to shine. I belong to you, sweetheart.",
"Between you and I, there’s love nestled comfortably, gloriously beaming its light of tender affection on our young hearts and urging us to stick to the goodness it reveals in us.",

"Whenever you are in a bad place in your life, just remember that you have someone out there who roots for your happiness. That person is me.",
"Your love inspires me to aim for the top in my career. It pushes me on and challenges me to take charge and to bring home results of sweet-smelling savor!",

"Anytime I want to tell you how much you mean to me. I find it hard to capture the essence of your value in mere words. Yet, my heart won’t let me rest until I speak out its desire. The best way I can say it is that you are, to me, a diamond discovered in the most unexpected place. Do you know what is done with such a treasure? It is cherished and esteemed above any other item of an endowment. That is how I value you, my priceless jewel.",
"Comparing the before and after years of my life with you, I must confess that I am one of the luckiest gents alive to be in a relationship with a lady with a heart of gold. You don’t even have to believe it; you are too modest to accept that you are special. But that doesn’t stop me from screaming my good luck to the hearing of the whole world.",
"Thank you for loving me like I am the only man in the entire universe. If you think I ignore your sweet care, then you are quite mistaken, bae.",
"We were at the right place and time for our first meeting, which became the first step into our blissful romance. After all these years, your brightness hasn’t dimmed for once in my eyes. And indeed, my love for you doesn’t seem to get tired of ravaging your entire being. Come what may, you’ll remain that young girl with a svelte figure who I accidentally bumped into on a busy school campus.",
"I have had my fair share of wins and failures. But I can guarantee you that loving you has been the most significant victory in my short life.",
"Love is not something that you can express in words. Love is something that is represented by actions and felt with the heart. I don’t know how much loved I make you feel but trust me, dear, you are the most precious thing in my life. I love you!",
"You have made me believe that fairytales are real. Thanks to you, we don’t even have to try, and it is always a good time when we are together. May God keeps blessing us, and hope has stored everything best for us. I love you, sweetheart.",
"Loving someone with my whole heart and getting the same amount of love back has always been a dream- thank you for making it possible. Dear girlfriend, I cannot help but think of myself as the luckiest person, because I have you.",
"You have a very distinctive pair of eyes. Whenever I look into them, I find myself lost in an ocean of infinite hope, happiness, and peace. This hope keeps me alive, that happiness surrounds me every moment in my life, and that peace reminds me that I’m in heaven.",
" I can create another odyssey describing my love for you. You have such a profound influence on my life that I cannot erase the memories of you even if I live for a million years. I am lucky to be part of your life. I will love you till my last breath!",
"You have made me realize how much power the word “love” holds and definitely made me understand the true meaning of romantic love. Thanks for being such a kind, understanding, and generous human being. You inspire me a lot. Love you, baby girl.",
"You are a ray of living, breathing sunshine who holds power to burn out everything around her with her beauty. Also, you have the sweetest smile, which melts my heart, darling. Thank you for being a competition to Aphrodite, the beautiful goddess envies you- I bet.",
"I am so attached to you now that only death can separate us from each other—every moment, I find myself thinking about you. You have become the reason for my smile, the meaning of my life, and the inspiration for tomorrow.",

"A day without you makes me want the question of the existence of planet Earth. Dear love, you keep me going even on my most vulnerable days. Without you, I cannot breathe; without you, I am incomplete. I love you so much, babe.",
"You and I, both ending up together, was not an accident. Our story was written in the stars even before we met each other. I thank God every day from the core of my heart for this! I wish you knew how much I adore you. I love you!",
"Dear, I am glad to inform u that I have fallen in love with you since the first day I met you. I would like to present myself as a prospective lover. Our love affair would be on probation for a period of two months. Upon completion of probation, there will be a performance appraisal leading to promotion from lover to spouse.","Wow! I think I am 101% in love with you. Can I be so bold as to invite you to study with me Saturday afternoon and after, invite you to go to the movies and then, invite you to go to dinner and then, invite you to go dancing and then, if you were not tired of my lack of objectivity, ask you a kiss?The answer, please, or shorten the process by giving me this kiss at once!","I sent an Angel to watch over you while you were asleep, but sooner than expected, the Angel came back, and I asked why the Angel said Angels don\"t watch over an Angel!","I may annoy you, and you might want to kill me. I permit you but on one condition. Don’t shoot me in the heart, because that’s where you are!","If you were Romeo and I were Juliet; our story would have been slightly different than the original one written by Shakespeare. We wouldn’t have died for each other in the end – we would have lived for each other even after the end. I love you.","Your smile can be compared to a flower. Your voice can be compared to a cuckoo, Your innocence to a child, But in stupidity, you have no comparison, You’re the best!","Mathematicians would have been correct if \"You plus me\" equals “Perfect Love.” Isn’t that what we are! Thanks for being mine.","I think you are suffering from a lack of vitamin \"Me’.I love you with all my belly. I would say heart but my belly is bigger.","Your dad must have been a thief because he stole all the stars in the sky and put them in your eyes!","If you were cheese, I would be a mouse so I can nibble you bit by bit. If you were milk, I would be a cat so I can drink you sip by sip. But if you were a mouse, I would still be a cat so I can devour you piece by piece. I love you.",
"I want to spend every second of every day with you. If I could, I would stop eating and sleeping just so that I could devote more time to being with you. You have changed my entire outlook on love. Even though I have been hurt many times, I believe in love again because I have found true love with you.","Never in my life have I felt more dedicated to anything. I pledge my life and my love to you, and I promise to keep investing my time and energy into the beautiful relationship that we have together. Every day I learn something new about you, and I am always reminded of how amazing you are. Together, we can have the most excellent adventure of all time.","Your happiness is my responsibility. If I don\"t keep you smiling, who would? I love you till infinity.","The quality of my life is a function of the amount of peace that you infuse into it. Also, no one spends an hour with you without feeling refreshed, renewed, and repositioned for excellence. There are so many things to love in you. First off, I promise to love you forever.","No one else makes my heart leap for joy with their presence. The sweetness of your love doesn’t give any room for doubts. I will love you forever, I promise.","By your side is where I belong. With you, I can break boundaries and make mountains move. There’s so much energy to be drawn from you, sweetheart. Doing life with you is all that makes sense to me. I can’t ask for anything else but your love. I will love you forever.","My love for you has no beginning and no end. It is cyclical, like life. It is ever-flowing, like the oceans. It is as boundless as the sky and as vast as the universe. When I see your face, I see my past, my present, my future. When I hold your hand, I feel everything inside of me expand. You are my everything. ","Permit me to say that I am completely in love with you. Maybe it took me a while to say it, but I can’t suck it in any longer. My life hasn’t been the same ever since the day I met you. I am greedy, I know. I just want more of you. I want everything about you.","You are my opposite. It’s funny the way we are very different yet complement each other perfectly. Our differences don’t keep our love from flowing perfectly. Indeed, you were created to complete me. No other person can do it. I love you with every part of my being.","There may be thousands of ways to say I love you, but I would instead show you. Thank you for letting me show you every day just how much I care for you."
,"Sweetheart, I wanted to write you a love letter. I know it\"s a little silly but I thought I’d try anyway. It’s just that I feel so much when I’m with you that I try to put it in words, so that you know how I feel about you. You are such a gift to me. Having you in my life is such a blessing.","You are my happiness, my heart desire, my everlasting flame, the one that makes my heart beat fast. My love, my queen, I cannot think for a second without you in my mind. I cherish you, princess of beauty.","Whenever I’m with you, I’m different but in a good way. I smile and laugh more, and I don’t have to pretend that everything is okay. With you, I can drop the facade and just feel and express everything genuinely. I no longer feel hurt and alone; and instead, I feel safe and loved. You’re so easy to talk to, to open up to. And in turn, everything you say resonates with me like no other. You have shown me that there is one person who can love me for who I am in this world filled with apathy. I appreciate you being here because, with you, I’m different. With you, I’m happy.","They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but I can only say three words when I look at your picture: I love you.","A girl like you with a heart of gold deserves all the good things in this life, and I am prepared to go the extra mile to see you have these in your life; I know you would do the same for me even more, that’s a fact. When I look into your eyes, I am connected to your soul; all I see is profound love. I see a reminder of why I must work hard to give you everything you will ever need. You have made me a complete person. Thank you, my love.","You have always been my biggest supporter and fan. You’ve always had my back, and in your eyes, I can do nothing wrong, which has built my confidence throughout my life. Thank you, darling, for loving me unconditionally and forever! You have made me the man I am today, and I will always love you with all my heart. People say they would love to have a wife that would do anything for her husband. I have that in you, and I appreciate everything you do and have always done in my life. You will be the love in my heart to eternity.","I just wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you. Thank you for everything you’ve done for me. Thank you for loving me and accepting me unconditionally and providing me with undivided love and attention. You’ve been there for me through everything. Thank you for helping me grow into the man I have become.","In love alphabets, \"U’ and ‘I’ were placed close to each other because Without U (You), I (am) nothing. I find my purpose in your sight, and I exist for your love forever.","I have for the first time found what I can truly love—I have found you. You are my sympathy—my better self—my good angel; I am bound to you with a strong attachment. I think you are good, gifted, lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you, draws you to my center and spring of life, wraps my existence about you—and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one. ","You are my strength. You are not only the sails that steer my ship, but you are also the waves below that carry me. Without you, I would cease to have a backbone, as you are the entire foundation holding me up. I could never think of a day where you are not with me. I imagine if that day came, I would become weak. I would crumble into a coward. But together, we are strong. We are unstoppable. That is why I love you.",
"You are my happiness, the only treasure I adore with an absolute passion. Since you came into my world, my life has never remained the same. You brought an endless smile to my face, a fantastic joy to my heart. Baby, I love you!","The sun is rising in the sky, but to me, the day doesn\"t start until you’ve risen out of bed.

Thank you for being you and for having me by your side.","I keep loving you every day because you are the one for me. My love keeps growing stronger every second, and I can’t explain how happy I am. Will you please explain what you did to my heart that I can’t stop thinking of you?","You are my world. I’ve honestly fallen deeply in love with you, and I am not afraid to say it. We have been through thick and thin, and we are still going strong. I can’t imagine my life without you by my side. I love you so much I can’t even explain it!

I cherish you, princess of beauty.","Our love is extraordinary, and there is no other love like ours in the world. I feel as if I have won the lottery with you, someone who is so unique and magical, who makes my life and my world a thousand times better just by being there. When I look at you, I know that I have indeed hit the jackpot. All you have to do to warm my heart is to be the loving, caring person you are.

I couldn’t go to sleep without telling you I love you and wishing you sweet dreams. So, this is me saying good night, and I love you. I’m excited to wake up in the morning and start a new day with you.","At night, there was the feeling that we had come home, feeling no longer alone, waking in the night to find the other one there, and not gone away; all other things were unreal. We slept when we were tired and if we woke the other one woke too so one was not alone. Often a man wishes to be alone and a woman wishes to be alone too and if they love each other they are jealous of that in each other, but I can truly say we never felt that. We could feel alone when we were together, alone against the others. We were never lonely and never afraid when we were together. – Ernest Hemingway","Dear Heart, I love you with all my heart.
